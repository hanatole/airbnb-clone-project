## üîí API Security

### Key Security Measures

| **Security Measure**                          | **Description**                                                                                                 | **Purpose**                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication (JWT)**                      | Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using `djangorestframework-simplejwt` to verify user identity for each request. | Ensures only authenticated users can access protected endpoints and prevents unauthorized access.                     |
| **Authorization (Role-Based Access Control)** | Define user roles (e.g., *admin*, *host*, *guest*) and restrict access to resources accordingly.                | Prevents users from performing actions outside their permission level (e.g., guests editing another host‚Äôs property). |
| **HTTPS & SSL Encryption**                    | Enforce HTTPS to encrypt all traffic between client and server.                                                 | Protects sensitive data (like passwords and payment info) from interception or tampering.                             |
| **Rate Limiting & Throttling**                | Configure DRF throttling to limit requests per user/IP.                                                         | Reduces brute-force login attempts and prevents API abuse.                                                            |
| **Input Validation & Sanitization**           | Validate and sanitize all incoming data to avoid malicious payloads.                                            | Prevents injection attacks (SQL, XSS) and ensures data integrity.                                                     |
| **Password Hashing**                          | Use Django‚Äôs built-in password hashing (PBKDF2 by default).                                                     | Keeps user passwords secure even if the database is compromised.                                                      |
| **Secure File Uploads**                       | Validate file types and store uploaded media safely (e.g., AWS S3).                                             | Prevents malicious file uploads or code execution.                                                                    |
| **CORS & CSRF Protection**                    | Use `django-cors-headers` and Django‚Äôs CSRF middleware.                                                         | Blocks unauthorized cross-origin requests and protects session data.                                                  |
| **Logging & Monitoring**                      | Track authentication attempts, API usage, and unusual activity.                                                 | Helps detect intrusions early and supports audit trails.                                                              |

### Why Security Is Crucial

| **Area**                           | **Why It Matters**                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Data Protection**           | Users share personal details (emails, phone numbers, identities). Securing this data builds trust and ensures compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR). |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive actions like bookings, payments, or user details.                                                              |
| **Payments**                       | Ensures safe transaction processing and protects against fraud, chargebacks, or payment data theft.                                                      |
| **Property & Booking Information** | Prevents unauthorized users from accessing or modifying property details, bookings, or host information.                                                 |
| **Platform Integrity**             | Maintains system reliability, reputation, and user confidence by minimizing the risk of data breaches.                                                   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### What Is a CI/CD Pipeline?

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates
the process of building, testing, and deploying your application.
It ensures that every code change passes through a consistent workflow before
reaching production ‚Äî reducing human error, improving reliability, and speeding
up development.

### Why CI/CD Pipeline?

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automation & Efficiency**   | Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment, allowing developers to focus on writing code.             |
| **Early Bug Detection**       | Runs tests automatically after each commit, helping catch errors early in the development cycle.                  |
| **Consistency & Reliability** | Ensures that all deployments follow the same verified steps, reducing environment inconsistencies.                |
| **Faster Delivery**           | Speeds up feature releases and updates by integrating and deploying continuously.                                 |
| **Improved Collaboration**    | Enables multiple developers to work seamlessly by merging code frequently and automatically testing integrations. |
